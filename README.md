# Machine-Learning

STEPS:

1, data preprocess for knowledge graph, to integtate as much information as possible
   drug-target graph (target is protein)
   protein-protein graph
   drug-drug graph
   ....

2, knowledge graph embedding for features
   network embedding here: https://towardsdatascience.com/graph-embeddings-the-summary-cc6075aba007
   knowledge graphs have different kinds of edges, the embedding is more difficult.

3, machine learning methods on the features to predict drug-drug combination

4, interpretation/verification of the results, paper review.
